for DATA3320: exploring if school performance on the SAT or ACT can be predicted by socioeconomic factors.

## Data

  The **EdGap Data Set** contains information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district from 2016

All socioeconomic data (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

EdGap.org report that ACT and SAT score data is from each state’s department of education or some other public data release. The nature of the other public data release is not known.

The quality of the census data and the department of education data can be assumed to be reasonably high.

EdGap.org do not indicate that they processed the data in any way. The data were assembled by the EdGap.org team, so there is always the possibility for human error. Given the public nature of the data, we would be able to consult the original data sources to check the quality of the data if we had any questions.


  The **School Information Data** is from the National Center for Education Statistics. This data set consists of basic identifying information about schools and can be assumed to be of reasonably high quality. As for the EdGap.org data, the school information data is public, so we would be able to consult the original data sources to check the quality of the data if we had any questions.

The data set EdGap_data.xlsx can be accessed from the Github repository for DATA 3320 in the education Links to an external site. folder. 

The data set ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv is too large for Github and can be accessed from the dropbox link:
