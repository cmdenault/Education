## Data

  The **EdGap Data Set** contains information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district from 2016. All socioeconomic data (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.

[EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) report that ACT and SAT score data is from each state’s department of education or some other public data release. 

  The **School Information Data** is from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp). This data set contains basic identifying information about schools.

The data set EdGap_data.xlsx can be accessed from the Github repository for DATA 3320 in the [education](https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320/tree/main/education) folder.
